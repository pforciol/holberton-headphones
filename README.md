# Holberton Headphones

In this project, I had to implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. I used all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I already learned previously.

The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the [designer file](https://imgur.com/a/L8Ni7zC).

##### Design by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.
