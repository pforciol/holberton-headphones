# Holberton Headphones

In this project, I had to implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. I used all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I already learned previously.

The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the [designer file](https://imgur.com/a/L8Ni7zC).

You can grab a copy of the Figma design page clicking [here](https://www.figma.com/file/JKBtcroYNVYBitp5w956l6/Holberton-School-Headphone-company-Copy?node-id=0%3A1).

Here are the constraints:

-   the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is `480px` or less
-   links hover/active: `#FF6565`
-   button hover/active: `opacity: 0.9`
-   max width of the content: `1000px` centered in the page
